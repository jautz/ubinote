# Template for config file ".ubinote"
#
# * Depending on the existence of runtime environment variables put this file
#   * either into $HOME
#   * or one directory level below the $DOCUMENT_ROOT
#   * or into the script's working directory (NOT RECOMMENDED for public use)
#   Whereever you put it, make sure the file is readable for the webserver process
#   but not accessible from the internet because it contains the DB credentials.
#
# * Adapt it to your needs
